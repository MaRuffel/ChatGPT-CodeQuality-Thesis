It's hard to give specific advice without context or information about what the code is supposed to do, but here are a few general suggestions to improve this code:

Add comments and documentation: The code is not well commented and lacks documentation, which makes it hard to understand. Adding comments and documentation would make it easier for other developers to understand what the code does and how to use it.

Refactor the for loop: The infinite for loop can be replaced with a while loop that checks for a condition, making the code more readable and easier to understand.

Simplify the if statements: The if statements are complex and nested, making it difficult to follow the logic. Simplifying the if statements would make the code easier to read and maintain.

Use more descriptive variable names: The variable names are not very descriptive and do not give any information about their purpose. Using more descriptive variable names would make the code easier to understand.

Break down the method into smaller methods: The method is quite long and complex, which makes it hard to understand. Breaking down the method into smaller methods that each do one thing would make the code easier to read and maintain.

Use standard formatting: The code does not follow standard formatting conventions, which can make it hard to read. Using standard formatting conventions would make the code easier to read and maintain.
