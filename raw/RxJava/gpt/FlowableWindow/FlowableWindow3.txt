Without any additional context, it's difficult to know exactly what this code does or what problem it's trying to solve. However, here are some general tips for improving the code:

Improve readability: The code is quite difficult to read due to its dense formatting and lack of comments. Adding comments and spacing the code out more could make it easier to understand.

Use descriptive variable names: Variable names such as a, q, d, and t are not very descriptive and make it harder to understand what the code is doing. Consider using more descriptive names that explain the purpose of each variable.

Extract methods: The drain() method is quite long and complex, which makes it harder to understand and maintain. Consider breaking it up into smaller methods with clear names that explain what each method does.

Use more modern concurrency primitives: The use of getAndIncrement() and addAndGet() suggests that this code may be quite old. Consider using more modern concurrency primitives such as AtomicInteger and CompletableFuture to simplify the code and make it easier to reason about.

Simplify control flow: The code contains several if statements nested inside loops, which can make it hard to follow the control flow. Consider refactoring the code to use simpler control flow structures such as while loops or switch statements.
