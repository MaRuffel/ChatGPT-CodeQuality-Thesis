Without any additional context on the purpose of this code, it is challenging to determine what improvements could be made. However, here are some general suggestions for improving the code:

Use descriptive variable names: variable names like a, q, d, and v do not convey what they represent, which makes the code harder to read and understand. Using more descriptive names will make it easier to understand the code's purpose.

Simplify nested loops: the code has two nested loops, which can be challenging to read and understand. Consider refactoring the code to eliminate the nested loops, which could make the code more readable and easier to understand.

Use early returns: the code has multiple return statements within nested conditional statements. Consider refactoring the code to use early returns, which could make the code more readable and reduce nesting.

Use try-with-resources: if the SimpleQueue object is a resource that needs to be closed, consider using the try-with-resources statement to ensure that it is correctly closed even in the event of an exception.

Use functional programming constructs: consider using functional programming constructs like Stream and lambda expressions to simplify the code and make it more readable.

Provide documentation: The code lacks any documentation or comments. Adding inline comments and function/class-level documentation would help other developers to understand the code more easily.

Use type inference: The code seems to be using Java Generics. Use Java 7's type inference feature to make the code more concise and readable.

Reduce Cognitive Complexity: The code has a high cognitive complexity score. Consider refactoring the code to simplify it and make it more readable.

In summary, improving code requires a deep understanding of the problem the code is trying to solve. Nonetheless, by following good programming practices like writing clean code, commenting, and providing documentation, one can improve code quality.
