It's difficult to know how to improve the code without context or additional information about what it does. However, here are some suggestions for general improvements:

Use meaningful variable names: Instead of using short variable names like "r", "q", and "U", use descriptive names that convey the purpose of the variable.

Break down long if statements: Long if statements can be difficult to read and understand. Consider breaking them down into smaller, more manageable pieces.

Avoid long methods: Try to break down the method into smaller, more focused methods that each do one thing well. This will make the code more modular and easier to understand.

Use constants for magic numbers: Magic numbers (e.g., 0, 1, Long.MAX_VALUE, Integer.MAX_VALUE) should be replaced with named constants or enums to make the code more readable and less error-prone.

Add comments: Add comments to explain the purpose and behavior of the code. This will make it easier for others to understand and maintain the code.

Use try-with-resources for resources: If any resources are used (e.g., streams, connections), they should be wrapped in try-with-resources blocks to ensure they are properly closed.

Use assertions: Use assertions to ensure that certain conditions are met during development and testing.

Remove unnecessary code: Remove any code that is not being used or is redundant.

Follow coding standards: Follow coding standards for the programming language being used, such as naming conventions and indentation.

Test thoroughly: Test the code thoroughly to ensure it works as expected and to catch any bugs or issues.
